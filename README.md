**Simple GoPro file management application**

The filename pattern has changed with the newest GoPro models which causes them to be displayed in an undesirable order in a file explorer making it difficult to view and rename segmented files.
This utility streamlines the process of grouping and renaming segmented video files.

1. Loads all video files GoPro Hero 7 in a folder
1. Groups segmented videos in list view
1. Displays metadata for each video file
1. Edit seperate fields used to build name
1. Batch process all files in new screen
